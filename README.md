# üÉè Cards Cartel Sniper

Cards Cartel is a high-speed, automated monitoring tool designed to "snipe" undervalued Pok√©mon card listings from the Magic Eden marketplace. It operates by continuously fetching the latest listings, enriching them with real-time valuation data from ALT.XYZ, and sending instant alerts to a Discord channel for potentially profitable deals.

The primary goal is to create a robust, 24/7 pipeline that can be deployed on a cloud server (like AWS) for continuous, unattended operation.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **High-Speed Monitoring:** Checks for new Magic Eden listings every 0.6 seconds.
-   **Intelligent Filtering:** Filters for specific grading companies (PSA, BGS) and blacklists irrelevant keywords.
-   **Data Enrichment:** Pulls real-time valuation, population count (supply), and market data from ALT.XYZ for accurate price comparison.
-   **Price Conversion:** Uses a cached price feed from CoinGecko to convert SOL prices to USDC for consistent value comparison.
-   **Configurable Snipe Logic:** Business logic is easily adjustable to define what constitutes a "good deal" (e.g., listed at 15%, 20%, or 30% below market value).
-   **Instant Discord Alerts:** Sends richly formatted, detailed alerts to a designated Discord channel, with role-pinging for high-priority snipes.
-   **Persistent State:** Uses a local SQLite database to track processed listings, ensuring it doesn't re-process items after a restart.
-   **Robust & Resilient:** Designed with comprehensive error handling, API call retries, and self-healing loops to withstand network issues and run reliably for long periods.

## üöÄ Running the Bot

Once the setup is complete, you can start the sniper bot with a single command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will first check if the database exists. If not, it will perform a one-time "initial population" to fetch and process the 100 most recent listings. Afterward, it will start the high-speed watchdog to monitor for new listings.

# Project Roadmap

Here is a breakdown of the planned features, separated into backend and frontend tasks.

### Backend Development

These tasks involve the server-side logic, database management, API interactions, and the core bot functionality.

| Task                                     | Complexity | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implement `AUTOBUY` Logic**            | **High**   | This is a critical and complex task. It requires secure wallet integration, transaction signing, and robust error handling to prevent loss of funds.                                             |
| **Conditional Auto-snipe Rules**         | **High**   | Involves creating a system for users to define complex conditions (e.g., price, traits). The backend must persistently store these rules and have an efficient engine to evaluate them against real-time market data. |
| **Wallet Connection & Transactions**     | **High**   | The backend needs to securely handle wallet connections passed from the frontend, manage keys (or sessions), and execute transactions for buying. This includes calculating and adding priority fees (Jito). |
| **Sophisticated API Back-off Strategy**  | **Medium** | Implementing an exponential back-off or circuit breaker pattern to handle external API downtime gracefully. This improves bot stability.                                                      |
| **Azure Monitoring & Analytics**         | **Medium** | Setting up logging, monitoring, and alerts on Azure. The complexity can grow depending on how deep the analytics requirements are.                                                              |
| **Web Notifications Service**            | **Medium** | Requires a backend service (e.g., using WebSockets) to push real-time alerts (like successful snipes) to the web frontend.                                                                       |
| **Endpoint for Wallet Holdings**         | **Low-Medium** | Creating a new API endpoint that can query the blockchain for the assets held by a connected wallet and serve that data to the frontend.                                                        |
| **Force DB Re-population Argument**      | **Low**    | Adding a command-line flag to trigger a full database refresh. This is useful for development and maintenance.                                                                                 |

### Frontend Development

These tasks involve the user interface and user experience on the web dashboard.

| Task                             | Complexity | Notes                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wallet Connection UI**         | **High**   | Implementing the UI and logic for connecting a user's wallet (e.g., via WalletConnect). This is the entry point for all wallet-related features. |
| **"Instant Buy" Button & Logic** | **Medium** | Creating the UI for a one-click buy button, including a confirmation modal and a checkbox to disable it. This will trigger the backend autobuy logic. |
| **UI for Conditional Auto-snipe**| **Medium** | Designing and building a form or section in the sidebar where users can set and save their auto-snipe conditions (e.g., price, traits).      |
| **Display Wallet Holdings**      | **Medium** | Creating a new section or component in the UI to display the user's current NFT holdings fetched from the new backend endpoint.                |
| **Priority Fee Controls**        | **Low-Medium** | Adding a slider or input fields in the sidebar for users to set their desired priority fees for transactions.                                |
| **Web Notifications Display**    | **Low-Medium** | Implementing the client-side logic to receive and display real-time notifications sent from the backend.                                     |

Based on your README.md and the API documentation, here are the high-priority backend tasks and their relation to the Magic Eden API:

AUTOBUY Logic (High Complexity): This is the core feature where the Magic Eden API is essential. The API provides an /instructions/buy endpoint. Your bot would call this endpoint with the token mint address, price, and buyer's wallet address. The API then returns the necessary transaction instructions.

Wallet Connection & Transactions (High Complexity): You are correct. A library like WalletConnect or another Solana-specific wallet adapter would handle the frontend UI for connecting the user's wallet. However, the transaction part is where the Magic Eden API comes back in. The AUTOBUY instructions generated by the API need to be signed by the user's wallet and submitted to the Solana network.

Conditional Auto-snipe Rules (High Complexity): This is primarily application logic you'll build. The Magic Eden API's /collections/{symbol}/listings endpoint provides the real-time data feed that your rules engine will process. When a listing meets your conditions, it will then trigger the AUTOBUY logic.

Regarding Your Concerns:
Auto-Buy Speed: This is a valid concern. The speed of an auto-buy depends on two things:

API Response Time: How fast the Magic Eden API gives you the transaction instructions. This is usually very fast.
Blockchain Confirmation Time: How fast your transaction is processed on the Solana network. This is the real bottleneck. To be competitive, you need to pay a priority fee. Your README.md mentions "Jito," which is exactly the right path. You would construct a transaction that includes both the buy instruction from the Magic Eden API and an additional instruction to pay a priority fee via Jito's block engine. The Magic Eden API won't handle the priority fee for you, but its instructions are compatible with being included in a transaction that does.
Wallet Holdings: Yes, the /wallets/{wallet_address}/tokens endpoint will give you the list of tokens a wallet holds.

In short, the Magic Eden API provides the crucial data (/listings) and transaction instructions (/instructions/buy) for your high-priority features. Your backend will be responsible for the logic, and for adding priority fees to the transaction to ensure speed.

What would be your next step? I can help you start scaffolding the Python code for the AUTOBUY logic.
