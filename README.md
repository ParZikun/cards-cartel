# üÉè Cards Cartel Sniper

Cards Cartel is a high-speed, automated monitoring tool designed to "snipe" undervalued Pok√©mon card listings from the Magic Eden marketplace. It operates by continuously fetching the latest listings, enriching them with real-time valuation data from ALT.XYZ, and sending instant alerts to a Discord channel for potentially profitable deals.

The primary goal is to create a robust, 24/7 pipeline that can be deployed on a cloud server (like AWS) for continuous, unattended operation.

---

## ‚ú® Features

-   **High-Speed Monitoring:** Checks for new Magic Eden listings every 0.6 seconds.
-   **Intelligent Filtering:** Filters for specific grading companies (PSA, BGS) and blacklists irrelevant keywords.
-   **Data Enrichment:** Pulls real-time valuation, population count (supply), and market data from ALT.XYZ for accurate price comparison.
-   **Price Conversion:** Uses a cached price feed from CoinGecko to convert SOL prices to USDC for consistent value comparison.
-   **Configurable Snipe Logic:** Business logic is easily adjustable to define what constitutes a "good deal" (e.g., listed at 15%, 20%, or 30% below market value).
-   **Instant Discord Alerts:** Sends richly formatted, detailed alerts to a designated Discord channel, with role-pinging for high-priority snipes.
-   **Persistent State:** Uses a local SQLite database to track processed listings, ensuring it doesn't re-process items after a restart.
-   **Robust & Resilient:** Designed with comprehensive error handling, API call retries, and self-healing loops to withstand network issues and run reliably for long periods.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Language:** Python 3.10+
-   **Core Libraries:**
    -   `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.
    -   `requests` for synchronous API calls in threaded executors.
    -   `discord.py` for Discord bot integration.
    -   `PyYAML` for configuration management.
-   **Database:** `sqlite3` for lightweight, local data persistence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd cards-cartel-sniper
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    requests
    discord.py
    python-dotenv
    PyYAML
    pytz
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your API keys and IDs. **Never commit this file to Git.**
    ```env
    # ALT.XYZ API Credentials
    AUTH_TOKEN="your_alt_auth_token"
    COOKIE="your_alt_cookie_string"

    # Discord Bot Configuration
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token"
    DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID="your_target_channel_id"
    DISCORD_ROLE_ID="role_id_to_ping_on_high_alert"
    ```

5.  **Configure Logging:**
    The `logging_config.yaml` file controls the log output. You can adjust the log levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`) as needed.

---

## üöÄ Running the Bot

Once the setup is complete, you can start the sniper bot with a single command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will first check if the database exists. If not, it will perform a one-time "initial population" to fetch and process the 100 most recent listings. Afterward, it will start the high-speed watchdog to monitor for new listings.
