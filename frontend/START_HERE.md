# 🚀 START HERE - Complete Setup Guide

Welcome! This is your one-stop guide to get the Cartel Pro Sniper Bot Dashboard up and running.

## 📋 What Has Been Built For You

A complete Next.js 14 dashboard with:
- ✅ 6 React components (Header, Footer, SearchBar, FilterControls, ListingGrid, Card)
- ✅ Dark futuristic theme with animated hexagon background
- ✅ Pokémon-inspired retro fonts (Press Start 2P, VT323)
- ✅ Gold accent colors and glassmorphism effects
- ✅ Fully responsive design (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- ✅ Complete documentation and setup automation

## 🎯 Your Installation Journey (3 Steps)

### Step 1️⃣: Verify Prerequisites

Open your terminal and check:

```bash
# Check Node.js (need 18.0.0 or higher)
node --version

# Check npm (need 9.0.0 or higher)
npm --version
```

**Don't have Node.js?**
- Download from: https://nodejs.org/
- Install the LTS (Long Term Support) version
- Restart your terminal after installation

### Step 2️⃣: Install Dependencies

Choose one of these methods:

#### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended) 🤖

```bash
cd /workspace/frontend
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check your Node.js installation
- ✅ Install all dependencies automatically
- ✅ Show you what was installed
- ✅ Give you next steps

#### Option B: Manual Setup 🔧

```bash
cd /workspace/frontend
npm install
```

**What happens during installation?**
- npm reads `package.json` to see what's needed
- Downloads packages into `node_modules/` directory
- Creates `package-lock.json` with exact versions
- Takes 1-3 minutes depending on your internet speed

**Success looks like:**
```
added 312 packages, and audited 313 packages in 45s
```

### Step 3️⃣: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Success looks like:**
```
- ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
- event compiled client and server successfully
```

**Now open your browser:**
- Visit: http://localhost:3000
- You should see the dark dashboard with animated background! 🎉

## 🎨 What You'll See

When you open http://localhost:3000:

1. **Animated Background** - Slowly panning hexagon pattern
2. **Header** - Logo + "Cartel Pro Sniper Bot" title + "Connect Wallet" button
3. **Search Bar** - Full-width search input with gold focus
4. **Filter Controls** - Dropdown menus for filtering and sorting
5. **Card Grid** - 12 placeholder cards in responsive grid
6. **Footer** - Copyright with heart icon

Try:
- ✨ Resize your browser to see responsive design
- ✨ Hover over cards to see gold glow effect
- ✨ Click in search bar to see gold focus ring
- ✨ Check on mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes

## 🎓 Understanding Node.js Dependencies (Important!)

### You Asked About Virtual Environments

In Python, you do:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In Node.js, you do:
```bash
npm install
# That's it! No activation needed!
```

### Why No Virtual Environment Needed?

Node.js **automatically isolates** each project:

```
project-A/
└── node_modules/     ← Dependencies for Project A only
    └── react@18.3.1

project-B/
└── node_modules/     ← Dependencies for Project B only
    └── react@17.0.2  (different version, no conflict!)
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Each project has its own `node_modules` directory
- ✅ Dependencies are installed locally (not globally)
- ✅ No need to activate/deactivate anything
- ✅ Different projects can use different versions
- ✅ `package-lock.json` ensures consistent installs

**For detailed explanation:** Read `SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## 🛠️ Common Commands

## 🔧 Customization Quick Guide

### Want to Change Colors?

Edit: `tailwind.config.js`
```javascript
colors: {
  primary: {
    gold: '#YOUR_COLOR_HERE',
  }
}
```

### Want to Change Fonts?

Edit: `app/styles/globals.css`
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YOUR_FONT&display=swap');
```

### Want to Change Grid Layout?

Edit: `app/components/ListingGrid.js`
```javascript
// Change these numbers:
className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5"
```

### Want to Add a New Component?

1. Create: `app/components/YourComponent.js`
2. Import in: `app/page.js`
3. Use: `<YourComponent />`

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "node: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### "Port 3000 is already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
npx kill-port 3000
# OR
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### "Cannot find module"
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Nothing happens after npm run dev
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Changes not showing in browser
**Solution:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache
